# Connect-4-Terminal-Game

Connect Four, also known as Four in a Row or Captain's Mistress, is a strategy game for two players, where each is represented by a distinct color: yellow (ðŸŸ¡) and red (ðŸ”´). The game is played on a vertical grid of six rows and seven columns. In each turn, the players alternate, letting their piece drop into the chosen column, occupying the lowest available slot. A round ends when a player wins, resigns, or when all positions on the grid are filled. The goal is to be the first to align four consecutive pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

In my first version, the game was implemented in Python 3.12.2 to be played directly in the terminal. Meanwhile, my second version was developed in Clojure. 

The program handles multiple rounds and keeps track of each playerâ€™s victories, continuing until the players decide to stop. 

The terminal interface provides prompts to help players understand each move, and after each turn, the updated grid is displayed, allowing players to visually track the gameâ€™s state. The gameâ€™s logic includes input validation to ensure that players choose only valid columns.

This project offers a simple and enjoyable way to play Connect Four on the computer while reinforcing programming skills.
