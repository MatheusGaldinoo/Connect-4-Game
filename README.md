# Connect-4-Game

Connect 4 (also known as Connect Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, and Drop Four) is a two-player strategy game where each player chooses a color and alternates turns dropping colored tokens into a vertical grid consisting of six rows and seven columns. The tokens fall straight down, occupying the lowest available slot in the chosen column. The goal is to be the first to align four of one's own tokens consecutively, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
